### Python Classes Implementing the SOLID Principles

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

	•	Principle: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.
	•	Real-World Example: Online Shopping System
	•	Imagine an Order class that does everything: it calculates order totals, processes payments, sends confirmation emails, and updates the order status.
	•	Violation of SRP: The Order class has multiple responsibilities. If any one of these features needs modification (e.g., updating the email template), the entire class might be affected.
	•	Solution with SRP: Divide the responsibilities into separate classes:
	•	OrderCalculator: Responsible for calculating the total.
	•	PaymentProcessor: Responsible for handling payments.
	•	EmailService: Responsible for sending emails.
	•	OrderManager: Manages the order state.
	•	Benefits: Each class has a single responsibility, making the system modular, easier to test, and easier to modify without affecting other parts.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

	•	Principle: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
	•	Real-World Example: Employee Salary Calculator
	•	Suppose you have a SalaryCalculator class that calculates salaries for different types of employees, like full-time and part-time.
	•	Violation of OCP: If you add a new employee type, say a contractor, you modify the SalaryCalculator class, adding a conditional to handle contractor pay, which makes the class fragile and prone to bugs.
	•	Solution with OCP: Use inheritance or interfaces to extend functionality:
	•	Create an Employee interface with a calculateSalary() method.
	•	Implement specific classes like FullTimeEmployee, PartTimeEmployee, and ContractorEmployee that each define their own salary calculation logic.
	•	Benefits: You can add new employee types by creating new classes without modifying the SalaryCalculator, adhering to OCP.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

	•	Principle: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the program’s correctness.
	•	Real-World Example: Vehicle Rental System
	•	Suppose we have a Vehicle class with a method startEngine(). Subclasses like Car and Truck inherit Vehicle and implement startEngine().
	•	Violation of LSP: If we add a subclass Bicycle that inherits Vehicle but cannot logically implement startEngine() (because bicycles don’t have engines), we violate LSP.
	•	Solution with LSP: Separate classes by capabilities:
	•	Create an EngineVehicle class for vehicles with engines, and have Car and Truck inherit from it.
	•	Create a separate NonEngineVehicle class for bicycles.
	•	Benefits: LSP ensures that any subclass can be used as a substitute for the superclass, preventing issues when types are mixed.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

	•	Principle: A client should not be forced to implement interfaces it doesn’t use. Use smaller, specific interfaces instead of one large interface.
	•	Real-World Example: Smart Home Devices
	•	Imagine a large SmartDevice interface that includes methods like turnOn(), turnOff(), setTemperature(), and setBrightness().
	•	Violation of ISP: Devices like a fan don’t need setTemperature() or setBrightness(), and a thermostat doesn’t need setBrightness(). Forcing them to implement these methods leads to a bloated design.
	•	Solution with ISP: Split the interface into smaller, specific ones:
	•	Switchable for turnOn() and turnOff().
	•	TemperatureAdjustable for setTemperature().
	•	BrightnessAdjustable for setBrightness().
	•	Benefits: Devices implement only the interfaces they need, creating a more modular design and reducing unnecessary dependencies.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

	•	Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (interfaces). Also, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
	•	Real-World Example: Notification System
	•	Suppose an application sends notifications by email or SMS, and the NotificationSender class depends directly on EmailService and SMSService.
	•	Violation of DIP: If NotificationSender directly instantiates EmailService or SMSService, adding a new method, like PushNotificationService, requires modifying NotificationSender.
	•	Solution with DIP: Introduce an INotificationService interface with a send(message) method:
	•	EmailService, SMSService, and PushNotificationService each implement INotificationService.
	•	NotificationSender depends only on INotificationService, not on specific implementations.
	•	Benefits: Adding new notification methods doesn’t require changes to NotificationSender. This makes the codebase flexible and easier to extend.

Summary of Benefits for Each Principle

	•	SRP: Increases modularity and readability by keeping classes focused on one task.
	•	OCP: Supports extension without modifying existing code, reducing the risk of breaking existing functionality.
	•	LSP: Maintains substitution integrity, ensuring subclasses can stand in for superclasses.
	•	ISP: Prevents “fat” interfaces, reducing dependencies and increasing modularity.
	•	DIP: Decouples high- and low-level modules, increasing flexibility and testability.

Following these SOLID principles helps create a codebase that’s modular, extensible, and easier to maintain.
